            <p>
            	Here are some scientific facts on the benefits of strength training for health and longevity:
            </p>

            <span class="research">
            <ol>
            	<li>Muscle Mass Preservation:</li>
            
            <ul>
            	<li>Strength training helps preserve and increase muscle mass, which is crucial for overall mobility, balance, and functionality, particularly as individuals age.</li>
            </ul>

            	<li>Bone Density Improvement:</li>

            <ul>
            	<li>Resistance training contributes to enhanced bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. It strengthens bones by placing stress on them, promoting bone health.</li>
            </ul>

           		<li>Tomatoes and Cancer Prevention:</li>

            <ul>
            	<li>Tomatoes contain lycopene, an antioxidant associated with a reduced risk of certain cancers, particularly prostate cancer.</li>
            </ul>

            	<li>Metabolism Boost:</li>

            <ul>
            	<li>Building and maintaining muscle through strength training can boost metabolism. Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue, supporting weight management.</li>
            </ul>

            	<li>Weight Control: </li>

            <ul>
            	<li>Regular strength training is effective for weight control and fat loss. It promotes a leaner body composition by increasing muscle mass and reducing body fat percentage</li>
            </ul>

            	<li>Improved Insulin Sensitivity: </li>

            <ul>
            	<li>Resistance training enhances insulin sensitivity, assisting in better blood sugar control. It is beneficial for individuals with or at risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            	<li>Joint Health:</li>

            <ul>
            	<li>Strengthening muscles around joints provides support and stability, reducing the risk of injuries and promoting joint health.</li>
            </ul>

            </ol>
